# Orbitflow: Kerbal Space Program + Temporal = ❤️

This repository has a little bit of fun with Temporal and Kerbal Space Program!

## Prerequisites

In order to use Orbitflow, you need to modify your Kerbal Space Program installation to have the kRPC mod (https://krpc.github.io/krpc/).

You'll also need to install Temporal and start the dev server with
`temporal server start-dev`.

With both of these installed, you can run the worker with `dotnet run` and go
to space!
